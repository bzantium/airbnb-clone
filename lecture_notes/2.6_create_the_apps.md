```
django-admin startapp {application_name}
```

Application name should be plural.
room -> rooms, user -> users

```
django-admin startapp rooms
django-admin startapp users
django-admin startapp reviews
django-admin startapp conversations
django-admin startapp lists
django-admin startapp reservations
```

The reason why we do not use 'messages' is that there is already django app called messages.
