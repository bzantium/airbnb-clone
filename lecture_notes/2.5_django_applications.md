Project is a group of applications.
Application is a group of functions.

Think of airbnb service.

for room, following functions would be required.
room search, create, reviews, reservation

for user,
user login, logout, password, google login, facebook login, message

You should never place all giant these thing on one folder!

We are going to divide and conquer.

List application only handles 'list'. create list, edit list, delete list, share list.
For reservation, create reservation, edit reservation, delete reservation etc.

You have to organize first.

You should know when to create application and when not to.
One criterion is that you can describe the application in one sentence.
Small Always!
